## Clear Night UI

Clear Night UI is a soothing dark theme for the Atom text editor. It is designed to work with Clear Night Syntax, but blends nicely with many other syntax themes.

> Clear Night UI is based on [Glacier Dark UI](https://github.com/berlouz/glacier-dark-ui)


#### Settings

Switch between 3 Layout Modes:

* Auto (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.
* Compact - In Compact mode, the UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.
* Spacious - In Spacious mode, the UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.
